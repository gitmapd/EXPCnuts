[1] draw inset grid rectangles using nested loops (x,y) and a "draw_rect_inset(canvas,min,max,color, inset_distance)"
[2] change that to "draw a grid" with a plugin function to draw the contents of each grid, e.g extent it to draw a grid 
of circles or grid of rectangles using the same grid loop code (need to read how to pass functions as variables, it's easy enough)
[3]  regarding Stepsize:  2 versions of the grid :   the first you have is told the grid cell size. the next version  divides 
the min-max area into a requested number of cells. e.g. "draw a 5 x 5 grid, across the whole screen, whatever size it is"
[4] draw a chessboard (alternating grid fill colours) swap those ideas around, see which seems easiest to approach
(you can use their draw filled outline function for the chessboard)
each one of those will introduce 1 new idea
